<sect>Authentication Configuration
<p>
The following sections in the config file can be used to configure authentication.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;Gatekeeper::Auth&rsqb;
<label id="gkauth">
<p>
The section defines the authentication mechanism / modules for the
<htmlurl url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="GNU Gatekeeper">.
After defining which modules to use, you have to add the corresponding
config sections for each modulke that you want to use.

A rule may results in one of these three codes: ok, fail, next.
<itemize>
<item><tt/ok/ - The request is authenticated by this module.
<item><tt/fail/ - The authentication fails and should be rejected.
<item><tt/next/ - The rule cannot determine the request.
</itemize>
There are also three ways to control a rule:
<itemize>
<item><tt/optional/ - If the rule cannot determine the request or accepts it, it is passed to next rule. Otherwise processing stops and the request is rejected.
<item><tt/required/ - The requests should be authenticated by this module, or it would be rejected. The authenticated request would then be passed to next rule.
<item><tt/sufficient/ - If the request is authenticated, it is accepted, or it would be rejected. That is, the rule determines the fate of the request. No rule should be put after a sufficient rule, since it won't take effect.
<item><tt/alternative/ - similar to the <tt/sufficient/ rule, except that if the module cannot determine request fate, the request is passed to a next module.
</itemize>

Currently supported modules: (most only support a subset of the ras or q931 actions)
<itemize>
<item><tt>SimplePasswordAuth/SQLPasswordAuth/H350PasswordAuth</tt>
<p>
These modules check the <bf/tokens/ or <bf/cryptoTokens/ fields of RAS message.
The tokens should contain at least generalID and password.
For <bf/cryptoTokens/, <bf/cryptoEPPwdHash/ tokens hashed by simple MD5 and
<bf/nestedcryptoToken/ tokens hashed by HMAC-SHA1-96 (libssl must be installed!)
are now supported. For <bf/tokens/ tokens hashed by CAT (Cisco Access Token)
and a clear text username/password are now supported.
The ID and password are read from <ref id="password" name="[SimplePasswordAuth]"> section,
or a SQL database for <tt/SimplePasswordAuth/ and <tt/SQLPasswordAuth/
modules. For H.350.2 authentication (<tt/H350PasswordAuth/)
the <ref id="h350settings" name="[GkH350::Settings]"> section connection information must be completed.

<item><tt>AliasAuth/SQLAliasAuth</tt>
<p>
The module can only be used to authenticate RegistrationRequest (RRQ).
The IP of an endpoint with a given alias should match a specified pattern.
For <tt/AliasAuth/ the pattern is defined in
<ref id="rrqauth" name="[RasSrv::RRQAuth]"> the section.
For <tt/SQLAliasAuth/, the pattern is retrieved from a SQL database as 
defined in the <ref id="sqlaliasauth" name="[SQLAliasAuth]"> section.

<item><tt>FileIPAuth</tt>
<p>
This module provides a simple way to restrict access to the gatekeeper
based on caller's IP or network.

<item><tt>PrefixAuth</tt>
<p>
The IP or aliases of a request with a given prefix must match a specified
pattern. See section <ref id="prefixauth" name="[PrefixAuth]"> for details.
Currently the module can only authorize
AdmissionRequest (ARQ) and LocationRequest (LRQ).

<item><tt>RadAuth</tt>
<p>
Provides authentication based on H.235 username/password
security scheme. Authenticates RRQ, ARQ and Q.931 Setup through remote
RADIUS servers. It passes to RADIUS servers the usernames and passwords
extracted from CAT (Cisco Access Tokens) <bf/tokens/ carried
inside RRQ, ARQ or Setup packets. Therefore if your endpoints do not
support CATs or you do not need an authentication scheme based on
individually assigned usernames/password then this module would not be appropriate
(but you may check the <tt/RadAliasAuth/ module).
See section <ref id="radauth" name="[RadAuth]"> for details.

<item><tt>RadAliasAuth</tt>
<p>
Provides authentication based on endpoint aliases
and/or call signaling IP addresses with remote RADIUS servers.
It does not need any H.235 <bf/tokens/ inside RAS messages,
so it can be used on a wider range of systems as compared to <tt/RadAuth/.
RRQ, ARQ and Q.931 Setup messages can be authenticated using this module.
See section <ref id="radaliasauth" name="[RadAliasAuth]"> for details.

<item><tt>SQLAuth</tt>
<p>
A powerful module to authenticate and authorize RRQ, ARQ, LRQ and Setup
messages. It can perform checks based on various parameters such as 
caller's number, destination number, username and more. It also supports
enforcing call duration limit, number rewriting, call routing, alias
verification and assignment.
See section <ref id="sqlauth" name="[SQLAuth]"> for more details.

<item><tt>CapacityControl</tt>
<p>
A flexible module to control inbound call volume with ability to configure
various conditions. IMPORTANT: It must be used in conjunction with the <tt/CapacityControl/
accounting module. See section <ref id="capctrl" name="[CapacityControl]"> for more details.
 
</itemize>

You can also configure a rule to check only for specific RAS messages.
The following example configures <tt/SimplePasswordAuth/ as an optional rule
to check RRQ and ARQ. If a RRQ is not checked (does not contain
<bf/tokens/ or <bf/cryptoTokens/ fields), it is checked by <tt/AliasAuth/.
The default is to check all supported requests.

<descrip>
<tag/Example 1:/
<tt/SimplePasswordAuth=alternative;RRQ,ARQ/<newline>
<tt/AliasAuth=sufficient;RRQ/<newline>
</descrip>

The example below authenticates all calls, checking signaling Setup
message details, using the RadAliasAuth module.

<descrip>
<tag/Example 2:/
<tt/RadAliasAuth=required;Setup/<newline>
<tt/default=allow/
</descrip>

This example checks endpoint registrations (RRQ) and call admissions (ARQ)
either by means of username/password (RadAuth) or alias/IP (RadAliasAuth).
Additionally, if the call is from an unregistered endpoint (and therefore
no RRQ or ARQ authentication has been performed), Setup message authentication
using RadAliasAuth takes place (SetupUnreg).

<descrip>
<tag/Example 3:/
<tt/RadAuth=alternative;RRQ,ARQ/<newline>
<tt/RadAliasAuth=alternative;RRQ,ARQ,SetupUnreg/<newline>
<tt/default=reject/
</descrip>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;FileIPAuth&rsqb;
<label id="fileipauth">
<p>
This section defines a list of IP addresses/networks which are allowed
to access gatekeeper resources. A list of allowed prefixes can be specified
together with an IP address. Supported Gatekeeper::Auth events are:
<tt/GRQ/, <tt/RRQ/, <tt/LRQ/, <tt/Setup/ and <tt/SetupUnreg/. Format
of a single entry is:
<p><tt/IP=[allow | reject][;prefix[,prefix...]]/
<p>
where IP is a single IP address, a network address (in A.B.C.D/M.M.M.M or A.B.C.D/LENGTH format or IPv6 format) or a string <tt/'any'/ or <tt/'*'/ to match any address.
The access list can also be loaded from an external file using <tt/include/ directive. During authentication, network mask length defines a priority for each
entry, so rule 192.168.1.1=allow takes precedence over 192.168.1.0/24=reject.
<p>
In addition the to endpoint's IP, you can specify a list of prefixes that the endpoint may call.
The destination prefixes are only checked on Setup messages.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;SimplePasswordAuth&rsqb;
<label id="password">
<p>
The section defines the userid and password pairs used by
<tt/SimplePasswordAuth/ module. All passwords are encrypted
using the <tt/addpasswd/ utility.

Usage:
<tscreen><verb>
addpasswd config section userid password
</verb></tscreen>

Example:
<tscreen><verb>
addpasswd config.ini SimplePasswordAuth frank secret
</verb></tscreen>

Options:
<itemize>
<item><tt/KeyFilled=123/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Default value to use as a padding byte during password encryption/decryption.

<item><tt/CheckID=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Check if the aliases match the ID in the tokens.

<item><tt/PasswordTimeout=120/<newline>
Default: <tt/-1/<newline>
<p>
The module <tt/SimplePasswordAuth/ and all its descendants will cache an
authenticated password. This field defines the cache timeout value in seconds.
<tt/0/ means never cache the password, while a negative value
means the cache never expires.

<item><tt/DisableAlgorithm=MD5,H.235.1,CAT/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Disable H.235 authentication algorithms in the GRQ/GCF negotiation, otherwise all algorithms supported by GnuGk are used.
A disabled algorithm will still be used if it is used by an endpoint without negotiation.
This switch can be used to avoid incompatibilities with vendor implementations.

</itemize>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;SQLPasswordAuth&rsqb;
<label id="sqlpasswordauth">
<p>
Authenticate H.235 enabled endpoints using passwords stored
in the SQL database. This section defines the SQL driver to use,
SQL database connection parameters and the query to use to retrieve passwords.

Use the <ref id="database" name="common database configuration options">
to define your database connection for this module.

<itemize>
<item><tt/CacheTimeout=120/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
This field defines how long (alias;password) pairs retrieved from the database 
will be cached in the local memory. The cache timeout value is expressed in seconds.
<tt/0/ means to not cache passwords, while a negative value
means the cache never expires (only <tt/reload/ command will refresh the cache).

<item><tt/Query=SELECT .../<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Defines SQL query used to retrieve H.235 password from the database. The query
is parameterized - that means parameter replacement is made before each query
is executed. Parameter placeholders are denoted by <bf/%1/, <bf/%2/, ... strings.
Specify %% to embed a percent character before a digit into string (like <bf/%%1/),
specify <bf/%{1}/ to allow expansion inside complex expressions like <bf/%{1}123/.
For <tt/SQLPasswordAuth/ two parameters are defined:
<itemize>
<item><tt/%1/ - the actual alias to query the password for
<item><tt/%2/ - the gatekeeper identifier
</itemize>
<p>
Sample query strings:
<tscreen><verb>
SELECT h235password FROM users WHERE alias = '%1' AND active
SELECT h235password FROM users WHERE alias = '%1' AND gk = '%2'
</verb></tscreen>

</itemize>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::RRQAuth&rsqb;
<label id="rrqauth">
<p>
Specify the action on RRQ reception (confirm or deny) for <tt/AliasAuth/ module.
The first alias (this will mostly be an H323ID) of the endpoint to
register is looked up in this section. If a parameter is found the value will
apply as a rule. A rule consists of conditions separated by "&".
A registration is accepted when all conditions apply.

<descrip>
<tag/Syntax:/
<tscreen><verb>
&lt;authrules&gt; :=  empty  |  &lt;authrule&gt; "&" &lt;authrules&gt;

  &lt;authrule&gt;  := &lt;authtype&gt; ":" &lt;authparams&gt;
  &lt;authtype&gt;  := "sigaddr" | "sigip"
  &lt;autparams&gt; := [!&]*
</verb></tscreen>
</descrip>

The notation and meaning of <tt/&lt;authparams&gt;/ depends on
<tt/&lt;authtype&gt;/:

<itemize>
<item><tt/sigaddr/ - extended regular expression that has to match against the
``PrintOn(ostream)'' representation of the signal address of the request.
<p>
Example:
<tscreen><verb>
sigaddr:.*ipAddress .* ip = .* c0 a8 e2 a5 .*port = 1720.*
</verb></tscreen>

<item><tt/sigip/ - specialized form of `<tt/sigaddr/'.
Write the signaling IP address. If the port is omitted, 1720 is assumed.

<p>
Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
sigip:192.168.242.165:1720
sigip:[2a01:4f8:61:2243::2]:1720
sigip:2a01:4f8:61:2243::2
</verb></tscreen>

<item><tt/allow/ - always accept the alias.

<item><tt/deny/ - always reject the alias.

</itemize>

Example:
<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::RRQAuth]
; The endpoint with alias 'cwhuang' must register from 10.0.1.10:1720
cwhuang=sigip:10.0.1.10:1720
; The endpoint with alias 'gw1' must register from 10.0.1.0/24
gw1=sigaddr:.*ipAddress .* ip = .* 0a 00 01 .*port = 1720.*
; The endpoint with alias 'gw2' must register from [2a01:4f8:61:2243::2]:1720

<itemize>
<item><tt/RegQuery=SELECT .../<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Define a SQL query to be used to perform authentication and authorization
of endpoint registrations. The query is parameterized - that means parameter

<itemize>
<item><tt/%g/ - the gatekeeper identifier
<item><tt/%{gkip}/ - a gatekeeper IP the request has been received on

</itemize>
<p>
If the query returns no rows, the result is undefined, which basically

	<item>If there exists a column called <tt/'proxy'/, force the gatekeeper
          to enable/disable (depends on the 'proxy' column value) RTP proxy
          for this call
	<item>If there exists a column called <tt/'clientauthid'/, the gatekeeper will store
          this ID in its call record and send it back on all accounting events.
          This must be an unsigned integer with a maximum of 64 bits (eg. 'bigint unsigned' in MySQL).
</enum>
<item>If the request is denied, the remaining columns are examined:
<enum>
	<item>If there exists a column called <tt/'q931cause'/, set a Q.931 cause in a Release Complete

<sect1>Section &lsqb;PrefixAuth&rsqb;
<label id="prefixauth">
<p>
The section defines the authentication rule for the <tt/PrefixAuth/ module.
Currently, only ARQs and LRQs can be authorized by this module.

First, the most specific prefix is selected according to the <bf/destinationInfo/
field of the received request. Then the request is accepted or rejected
according to the matched rules with the most specific netmask.
If no matched prefix is found,
and the <tt/default/ option is specified, the request is accepted
or rejected according to that. Otherwise
it is rejected or passed to the next authentication module
according to the module requirement.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RadAuth&rsqb;
<label id="radauth">
<p>
This section defines configuration settings that enable
RADIUS authentication based on H.235 CATs (Cisco Access Tokens)
present in RRQ, ARQ RAS requests and Q.931 Setup messages.
<itemize>
<item><tt/Servers=SERVER1[:AUTH_PORT[:ACCT_PORT[:SECRET]]];SERVER2[:AUTH_PORT[:ACCT_PORT[:SECRET]]];.../<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
RADIUS servers to be used for authentication. The list can contain an arbitrary 
number of servers. The order of servers is important, because servers will 
be queried by the RADIUS module in the given order. If no port information 
is provided, port number from <tt/DefaultAuthPort/ will be used. If no secret is set, 
the default shared secret from <tt/SharedSecret/ is taken. 
Servers names can be IP addresses or DNS names. IPv6 addresses must always be written in brackets.

</descrip>

<item><tt/LocalInterface=IP_OR_FQDN/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
The specific local network interface that GnuGk should
use in order to communicate with RADIUS servers. This parameter
can be useful on NAT machines to restrict which network
interfaces are used for RADIUS communication. By default this value
is empty and allows RADIUS requests to be sent on any (best suitable)
network interface. If you are not sure what you are doing, it is
better to leave this option unset.

<item><tt/RadiusPortRange=10000-11000/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
By default, GnuGk
allocates ports dynamically as specified by the operating system.
If you want to restrict which ports it should use then configure this parameter.

<item><tt/DefaultAuthPort=PORT_NO/<newline>
Default: <tt>1812</tt><newline>
<p>
Default port number to be used for RADIUS authentication requests
(Access-Request packets).  Can be overridden by <tt/Servers/ attribute.

<item><tt/SharedSecret=SECRET/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A (empty string)</tt><newline>
<p>
Secret used to authenticate this GnuGk (NAS client) to RADIUS
server. It should be a cryptographically strong password. This is the default
value used if no server-specific secret is set in the <tt/Servers/ configuration option.
If <tt/EncryptAllPasswords/ is enabled, or a <tt/KeyFilled/ variable is defined
in this section, the password is in encrypted form and should be created using
the <tt/addpasswd/ utility.

<item><tt/RequestTimeout=TIMEOUT_MS/<newline>
Default: <tt/2000/ (milliseconds)<newline>
<p>
Timeout (milliseconds) for RADIUS server response to a request
sent by GnuGk. If no response is received within this time period,
the next RADIUS server is queried.

<item><tt/IdCacheTimeout=TIMEOUT_MS/<newline>
Default: <tt/9000/ (milliseconds)<newline>
<p>
Timeout (milliseconds) for RADIUS request 8-bit identifiers to be
unique. If the entire 8-bit identifier range is exhausted within this period,
a new client socket (UDP socket) will be allocated by the RADIUS module. Let's
take the example: we have approximately 60 RRQs/sec - after ca. 4 seconds
8-bit identifiers range gets exhausted - new socket allocated - after next
4 seconds the second 8-bit identifiers range gets exhausted - third socket
allocated - after 9th second identifiers from the pool 1 are available again.

In general, if you have too long a timeout then too many resources will be consumed.
If you have too short a timeout, then the RADIUS server may take incoming packets as duplicates
and therefore drop them.

<item><tt/SocketDeleteTimeout=TIMEOUT_MS/<newline>
Default: <tt/60000/ (milliseconds) - 60 s<newline>
<p>
Timeout for unused RADIUS sockets to be closed. It is used
in conjunction with <tt/IdCacheTimeout/ - additional sockets
created during heavy gatekeeper load periods for serving incoming
requests are closed during idle periods.

<item><tt/RequestRetransmissions=NUMBER/<newline>
Default: <tt/2/<newline>
<p>
How many times a single RADIUS request is transmitted to every
configured RADIUS server (if no response is received). 1 means
one transmission attempt and no re-transmission, 2 - single re-transmission, ... . Exact retransmission
method is defined by <tt/RoundRobinServers/ attribute.

<item><tt/RoundRobinServers=BOOLEAN/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
RADIUS requests retransmission method.
<p>
If set to 1, RADIUS request
is transmitted in the following way (until response is received):
<tscreen><verb>
Server #1 Attempt #1, Server #2 Attempt #1, ..., Server #N Attempt #1
...
Server #1 Attempt #RequestRetransmissions, ..., Server #1 Attempt #RequestRetransmissions
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
If set to 0, the following sequence is preserved:
<tscreen><verb>
Server #1 Attempt #1, ..., Server #1 Attempt #RequestRetransmissions
...
Server #N Attempt #1, ..., Server #N Attempt #RequestRetransmissions
</verb></tscreen>

<item><tt/AppendCiscoAttributes=BOOLEAN/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
If set, Cisco Vendor Specific RADIUS attributes are included
in RADIUS requests (h323-conf-id,h323-call-origin,h323-call-type).

<item><tt/IncludeTerminalAliases=BOOLEAN/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
If set, Cisco VSA 'h323-ivr-out' attribute is sent with a list of aliases
the endpoint is registering (RRQ.m_terminalAlias). This attribute is provided
in order to provide fine control over the list of aliases the endpoint
is allowed to register with. Format of this attribute is:
<tscreen><verb>
	Cisco-AV-Pair = "h323-ivr-out=terminal-alias:" alias [,alias] [;]
Example:
	Cisco-AV-Pair = "h323-ivr-out=terminal-alias:helpdesk,support,77771;"
</verb></tscreen>

<item><tt/UseDialedNumber=BOOLEAN/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Select Called-Station-Id number type between the original one (as dialed
by the user) - <tt/UseDialedNumber=1/ - and the rewritten one - <tt/UseDialedNumber=0/.

</itemize>

<sect2>&lsqb;RadAuth&rsqb; Access-Request Radius Attributes

<tt>h323-ivr-out="h323-ivr-out=terminal-alias:alias1,alias2,...,aliasN;"</tt><newline>
      The h323-ivr-out attribute can be (in future) instantiated multiple times
      inside a single Access-Request and may also contain variables other than
	  "terminal-alias", so a RADIUS server should be flexible enough 
	  with processing of this attribute.

For RRQs, the following RADIUS attributes are recognized 
inside Access-Accept packets:
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt>VSA: VendorId=Cisco, h323-return-code</tt><newline>
<p>
		If present and not 0, the request is rejected. This check is provided

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RadAliasAuth&rsqb;
<label id="radaliasauth">
<p>
This section defines configuration settings that enable
RADIUS authentication based on endpoint aliases and/or IP addresses
present in a RRQ RAS, ARQ RAS or Q.931 Setup request.
This authentication scheme is useful both for endpoints registered
at the gatekeeper (ARQ, RRQ) and calls from unregistered endpoints (Setup).

<itemize>
<item><tt/Servers=SERVER1[:AUTH_PORT[:ACCT_PORT[:SECRET]]];SERVER2[:AUTH_PORT[:ACCT_PORT[:SECRET]]];.../<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
RADIUS servers to be used for RAS requests authentication.
This list can contain an arbitrary number of servers. The order of servers 
is important, because servers will be queried by the RADIUS module 
in the given order. If no port information is specified, the port number from 
<tt/DefaultAuthPort/ will be used. If no secret is set, 
the default shared secret from <tt/SharedSecret/ is used.
Servers can be IP addresses or DNS names.

<descrip>
<tag/Example:/
<tt/Servers=192.168.3.1:1645;192.168.3.2:1812:1813:mysecret;radius.mycompany.com/
</descrip>

<item><tt/LocalInterface=IP_OR_FQDN/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Specific local network interface that GnuGk should
use in order to communicate with RADIUS servers. This parameter
can be useful on NAT machines to restrict number of network
interfaces used for RADIUS communication. By default this value
is empty and allows RADIUS requests to be sent on any (best suitable)
network interface. If you are not sure what you are doing, it is
better to leave this option unset.

<item><tt/RadiusPortRange=10000-11000/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
By default (if this option is not set) RADIUS client
allocates ports dynamically as specified by the operating system.
If you want to restrict RADIUS client to use ports from
a particular range only - set this parameter.

<item><tt/DefaultAuthPort=PORT_NO/<newline>
Default: <tt>1812</tt><newline>
<p>
Default port number to be used for RADIUS authentication requests
(Access-Request packets), if not overridden by <tt/Servers/ attribute.

<item><tt/SharedSecret=SECRET/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A (empty string)</tt><newline>
<p>
Secret used to authenticate this GnuGk (NAS client) to RADIUS
server. It should be a cryptographically strong password. This is the default
value used, if no server-specific secret is set in the <tt/Servers/.
If <tt/EncryptAllPasswords/ is enabled, or a <tt/KeyFilled/ variable is defined
in this section, the password is in encrypted form and should be created using
the <tt/addpasswd/ utility.

<item><tt/RequestTimeout=TIMEOUT_MS/<newline>
Default: <tt/2000/ (milliseconds)<newline>
<p>
Timeout (milliseconds) for RADIUS server response to a request
sent by GnuGk. If no response is received within this time period,
next RADIUS server is queried.

<item><tt/IdCacheTimeout=TIMEOUT_MS/<newline>
Default: <tt/9000/ (milliseconds)<newline>
<p>
Timeout (milliseconds) for RADIUS request 8-bit identifiers to be
unique. If all 8-bit identifier range is exhausted within this period,
new client socket (UDP socket) is allocation by RADIUS module. Let's
take the example: we have approximately 60 RRQs/sec - after ca. 4 seconds
8-bit identifiers range gets exhausted - new socket allocated - after next
4 seconds the second 8-bit identifiers range gets exhausted - third socket
allocated - after 9th second identifiers from the pool 1 are available again
- ... . In general, too long timeout - too much resources consumed,
too short timeout - RADIUS server may take incoming packets as duplicated
and therefore drop it.

<item><tt/SocketDeleteTimeout=TIMEOUT_MS/<newline>
Default: <tt/60000/ (milliseconds) - 60 s<newline>
<p>
Timeout for unused RADIUS sockets to be closed. It is used
in conjunction with <tt/IdCacheTimeout/ - additional sockets
created during heavy gatekeeper load periods for serving incoming
requests are closed during idle periods.

<item><tt/RequestRetransmissions=NUMBER/<newline>
Default: <tt/2/<newline>
<p>
How many times a single RADIUS request is transmitted to every
configured RADIUS server (if no response is received). 1 means
no retransmission, 2 - single retransmission, ... . Exact retransmission
method is defined by <tt/RoundRobinServers/ attribute.

<item><tt/RoundRobinServers=BOOLEAN/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
RADIUS requests retransmission method.
<p>
If set to 1, RADIUS request
is transmitted in the following way (until response is received):
<tscreen><verb>
Server #1 Attempt #1, Server #2 Attempt #1, ..., Server #N Attempt #1
...
Server #1 Attempt #RequestRetransmissions, ..., Server #1 Attempt #RequestRetransmissions

If set, Cisco Vendor Specific RADIUS attributes are included
in RADIUS requests (h323-conf-id,h323-call-origin,h323-call-type).

<item><tt/IncludeTerminalAliases=BOOLEAN/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
If set, Cisco VSA 'h323-ivr-out' attribute is sent with a list of aliases
the endpoint is registering (RRQ.m_terminalAlias). This attribute is provided
in order to provide fine control over the list of aliases the endpoint
is allowed to register with. Format of this attribute is:

Example:
	Cisco-AV-Pair = "h323-ivr-out=terminal-alias:helpdesk,support,77771;"
</verb></tscreen>

<item><tt/FixedUsername/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
If this parameter is set, it overwrites a value of User-Name RADIUS attribute
for outgoing RADIUS request. That means every Access-Request will be
authenticated as for user <tt/FixedUsername/.

<item><tt/FixedPassword/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
If not set, User-Password is a copy of User-Name. For example, if User-Name
is 'john' then User-Password will also be set to 'john'. Setting this
parameter overrides this behavior and User-Password attribute will be
always set to the value of <tt/FixedPassword/.
If <tt/EncryptAllPasswords/ is enabled, or a <tt/KeyFilled/ variable is defined
in this section, the password is in encrypted form and should be created using
the <tt/addpasswd/ utility.

<descrip>
<tag/Example 1:/
<tscreen><verb>
(Neither FixedUsername nor FixedPassword set)

<sect1>Section &lsqb;CapacityControl&rsqb;
<label id="capctrl">
<p>
This section contains a set of rules for controlling inbound call volume
depending on various conditions. In order for this module to work, CapacityControl
authentication and accounting modules have to be enabled like this:
<tscreen><verb>
[Gatekeeper::Auth]
CapacityControl=required;Setup
 
[Gatekeeper::Acct]
CapacityControl=required;start,stop
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
A capacity rule can be matched by a caller's IP, caller's H.323 ID and/or
caller's number (CLI) - in the order specified. In addition, the match can
be narrowed by specifying a called number pattern. This module works by keeping
lists of current call volume for each inbound route (rule) - this is done
by having <tt/CapacityControl/ accounting module configured to add/remove
active calls from matching routes. The <tt/CapacityControl/ authentication module
checks rules and accepts/rejects a call based on current/max call volume
for a matching inbound route.
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Format for an inbound route rule:/
<tt>[ip:CALLER_IP|h323id:CALLER_H323ID|cli:CALLER_NUMBER]=[CALLED NUMBER REGEX PATTERN] MAX_CAPACITY</tt>
<p>
<tt/ip:/, <tt/h323id:/ and <tt/cli:/ prefixes define rule type. An inbound call
will be matched either by caller's IP, H.323ID or CLI. The optional <tt/CALLED NUMBER REGEX PATTERN/
is a regular expression that the called number should match to apply this rule to.
<tt/MAX_CAPACITY/ is maximum number of active calls for this route.
<p>
The rules are match in the following order:
<itemize>
<item>IP rules
<item>H.323ID rules
<item>CLI rules
</itemize>

The longest match in the first matching category is used.

<tag/Example 1:/
<tscreen><verb>
[CapacityControl]
ip:192.168.1.0/24=30
ip:any=120
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
These rules tell that the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet can send up to 30 concurrent
calls, while all other IPs can send up to 120 concurrent calls.
 
<tag/Example 2:/
<tscreen><verb>
[CapacityControl]
%r1% cli:1001=30
%r2% cli:1001=^48(50|51) 5
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
These rules limit caller with CLI 1001 to send up to 5 calls to 4850/4851
destinations and up to 30 calls to other destinations. %r1% and %r2% are
special constructs to allow having the same <tt/cli:1001/ config key more
than once.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;GkH350::Settings&rsqb;
<label id="h350settings">
<p>
This section defines the LDAP server and standard H.350 directory operating
parameters to be used.

<itemize>
<item><tt/ServerName=127.0.0.1/<newline>
Default: <tt/127.0.0.1/
<p>
The LDAP server IP address.

<item><tt/ServerPort=389/<newline>
Default: <tt/389/
<p>
The LDAP server's TCP port (usually 389).

<item><tt/StartTLS=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/
<p>
Use StartTLS to encrypt the LDAP connection.

<item><tt/SearchBaseDN=ou=commObjects,dc=gnugk,dc=org/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt>
<p>
Entry point into the server's H.350 directory structure.
Searches are only made below this root node.

<item><tt/BindUserDN=cn=admin,dc=gnugk,dc=org/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt>
<p>
The distinguished name the gatekeeper uses to bind
to the LDAP server. Leave empty if you want to access
the LDAP server anonymously.

<item><tt/BindUserPW=secret/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt>
<p>
If you specified <tt/BindUserDN/, then specify the corresponding
password to be used for binding here.
If <tt/EncryptAllPasswords/ is enabled, or a <tt/KeyFilled/ variable is defined
in this section, the password is in an encrypted form and should be created 
using the <tt/addpasswd/ utility.

<item><tt/BindAuthMode=simple/<newline>
Default: <tt>simple</tt>
<p>
Bind Authentication method choices are <tt/simple,sasl,kerberos/

<item><tt/ServiceControl=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Use RRQ/RCF service control field to advise an endpoint of the H.350 directory 
and searchDN to use for white page lookups.

<item><tt/AssignedAliases=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Use H.350.1 to advise endpoints of their assigned aliases.

<item><tt/GatekeeperDiscovery=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Use H.350.1 to resolve on GRQ/GCF the registering endpoints assigned gatekeeper 
(h323IdentityGKDomain).
