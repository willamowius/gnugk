<sect>Getting Started (Tutorial)
<p>
<sect1>A simple first attempt
<p>
To confirm that all components are up and running, we will use
two Linux workstations, both connected to the same LAN.
In the examples, the H.323 client is a softphone called "SimpH323"
which comes as a sample application with H323Plus in the samples/simple/ folder.

On the first server start the <htmlurl url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="gatekeeper">
in direct mode:

<tscreen><verb>
jan@server1> gnugk -ttt
</verb></tscreen>

The "<tt/-ttt/" option tells the gatekeeper that it should be verbose and
print extra debug output to the console.  You can direct the output to a
file with "<tt/-o logfilename.log/"

Now, start SimpH323 on another console on the same system:
<tscreen><verb>
jan@server1> simph323 -l -a -u jan
</verb></tscreen>

SimpH323 is now listening (<tt/-l/) for calls and will automatically accept
them (<tt/-a/).  It has also registered with the gatekeeper as user "jan"
thereby allowing the gatekeeper to creating an association between the user
"jan" and their IP address.  

SimpH323 will attempt to automatically locate the gatekeeper, but if the auto
detection fails, use "<tt/-g 1.2.3.4/" to specify the IP address.

On the second client run simph323 this way:

<tscreen><verb>
peter@client2> simph323 -u peter jan
</verb></tscreen>

This instance of SimpH323 registers with the auto-detected gatekeeper as user
"peter" and tries to call user "jan".  The gatekeeper will accept the
request from "peter" and will determine if it can locate the IP address of a
user name "jan".  

Because "jan" has already registered with the gatekeeper, it will send
"jan"s IP address to "peter".  "peter"s SimpH323 will then use that IP
address to setup a direct session to "jan"s SimpH323 running on server1.

The instance of SimpH323 on server1 will automatically accept the call and Peter and Jan can chat.

<sect1>Using the Status interface to monitor the gatekeeper
<p>
The status interface presents a text-based means of interacting with an already-running gatekeeper.

On a new console we use telnet to connect to the gatekeeper:

<tscreen><verb>
jan@server1> telnet localhost 7000
</verb></tscreen>

You should receive an "Access forbidden!" message because by default, access to the status port is restricted.

Create a file called <tt/gatekeeper.ini/ in the
directory where we start the gatekeeper.
<tt/gatekeeper.ini/ will contain the following three lines:

<tscreen><verb>
[Gatekeeper::Main]
[GkStatus::Auth]
rule=allow
</verb></tscreen>

Stop the gatekeeper with Ctrl-C and restart it, but specify that it should use the <tt/gatekeeper.ini/ we just created:

<tscreen><verb>
jan@server1> gnugk -ttt -c ./gatekeeper.ini
</verb></tscreen>

Use telnet to connect to port 7000 and you should now be allowed to connect to the gatekeeper:

<tscreen><verb>
jan@server1>  telnet localhost 7000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

;
</verb></tscreen>

Now repeat the first experiment where Peter calls Jan and see which
messages are handled by the gatekeeper in non-routed mode.

There are a number of commands that can be issued in the telnet session - type "help" to see them.

To end the telnet session with the gatekeeper type "quit" and hit Enter.

The example configuration file we created is very insecure because it has a default <bf/allow/ rule, so there are no
restrictions on who can connect to the status port and which commands they may execute.

Change the configuration file to:

<tscreen><verb>
[Gatekeeper::Main]
[GkStatus::Auth]
rule=password
gkadmin=QC7VyAo5jEw=
</verb></tscreen>

The fourth line was added by the addpasswd utility, which was used to create a user "gkadmin" with 
password "secret".  This change now enforces authentication to the status port.

Restart the gatekeeper with this new configuration and perform the telnet again.
You should now be prompted for a username and password:

<tscreen><verb>
jan@server1>  telnet localhost 7000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

The <ref id="gkstatusauth" name="[GkStatus::Auth]"> section contains additional information on securing the status port.

<sect1>Running the gatekeeper in routed mode
<p>
Starting the gatekeeper in routed mode means that the gatekeeper
uses "gatekeeper routed signaling". 
All signaling messages go through the gatekeeper, giving it
much greater control over the calls.

Start GnuGk like this:
<tscreen><verb>
jan@server2> gnugk -r
</verb></tscreen>

will put the gatekeeper in routed mode. Telnet to the status port
and make a call to see what messages are now handled by the gatekeeper.

Note that all media packets (audio and video) are still sent
directly between the endpoints (the 2 instances of SimpH323).

<sect1>A virtual PBX: Disconnecting calls
<p>
Until now the gatekeeper has acted only as a mechanism
to resolve symbolic names to IP addresses. This is a critical function of
a gatekeeper, but the gatekeeper is capable of much more.

Because the gatekeeper has a lot of control over the calls,
it can also be used to terminate them. While
connected to the status port, you can list all active calls
with "<tt/PrintCurrentCalls/". To terminate a call, type
"<tt/Disconnectip 1.2.3.4/" for one of the endpoints.

For example, a simple script could be written to connect to
the status port, obtain a list of ongoing calls and terminate
them after 5 minutes to prevent users from using too many system resources.

Other functions such as TransferCall are also available.

<sect1>Routing calls to a gateway to reach external users
<p>
Without using a gateway you can only call other people with an
IP phone over the Internet. To reach people with ordinary telephones
you must use a gateway.

<tscreen><verb>
_________________          ______________
| endpoint "jan"|          |            |
| 192.168.88.35 |--------->| Gatekeeper |
|_______________|          |            |
_________________          |            |
| gateway "gw1" | outgoing |            |
| 192.168.88.37 |<---------|____________|
|_______________|
</verb></tscreen>

The gatekeeper must be configured to specify which calls should be routed
to the gateway and which numbers can be called directly.
Use the [RasSrv::GWPrefixes] section of the config file to tell
the gatekeeper the prefix of numbers that should be routed to the
gateway.

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]
gw1=0
</verb></tscreen>

This entry tells the gatekeeper to route all calls to E.164 numbers
starting with "0" to the gateway that has registered with the H.323
alias "gw1". If there is no registered gateway with that alias the
call will fail. 

<bf>NOTE:</bf> You must use the gateway alias - you cannot use the IP address of the gateway.

A prefix can contain digits <tt/0-9/, <tt/#/ and <tt/*/. It can also
contain a special character <tt/./ (a dot) that matches any digit
and can be prefixed with <tt/!/ (an exclamation mark) to disable the prefix.
Prefix matching is done according to the longest matching prefix rule,
with ! rules having higher priority if lengths are equal. You may also 
use := syntax to set the priority between several gateways matching the same prefix (see section <ref id="gwprefixes" name="[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]"> for details). 
Some examples:

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]
; This entry will route numbers starting with 0048 (but not with 004850 and 004860)
; to gw1
gw1=0048,!004850,!004860
; This entry will match only 001 with 10 digits following and route the call to
; gw2
gw2=001..........
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1>Rewriting E.164 numbers
<p>
When using a gateway you often have to use different numbers internally
and rewrite them before sending them over a gateway into the telephone
network. You can use the <ref id="rewrite" name="[RasSrv::RewriteE164]">
section to configure that.

Example:
You want to call number 12345 with your IP Phone and would like to
reach number 08765 behind a gateway called "gw1".

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]
gw1=0

[RasSrv::RewriteE164]
12345=08765
</verb></tscreen>

You can also configure rewriting of E.164 numbers based on which gateway
you are receiving a call from or sending a call to using the
<ref id="gwrewrite" name="[RasSrv::GWRewriteE164]"> section.

Example:
You have two different gateways ("gw1" and "gw2") which you are sending
calls with prefix 0044 to, but which require a different prefix to be
added to the number after the routing has selected the gateway. This
might be for identification purposes for example.

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]
gw1=0044
gw2=0044

[RasSrv::GWRewriteE164]
gw1=out=0044=77770044
gw2=out=0044=88880044
</verb></tscreen>

Example:
You want to identify calls from a particular gateway "gw1" with a specific
prefix before passing these calls to another gateway "gw2".

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]
gw2=1

[RasSrv::GWRewriteE164]
gw1=in=00=123400
</verb></tscreen>

Rewrite expressions accept dot <tt/'.'/ and percent sign <tt/'%'/ wildcard
characters to allow building more general rules. The dot character can occur
on both the left and right hand sides of expressions. The percent sign can occur
only at the left side. Use <tt/'.'/ to match any character and copy it
to the rewritten string and <tt/'%'/ to match any character and skip it.
A few simple examples:

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::RewriteE164]
; Rewrite 0044 + min. 7 digits to 44 + min. 7 digits
0044.......=44.......
; Rewrite numbers starting with 11 + 4 digits + 11  to 22 + 4 digits + 22
; (like 11333311 => 22333322, 110000112345 => 220000222345)
11....11=22....22
; strip the first four digits from all numbers (11114858345 => 4858345)
; this is equivalent of 10 rules %%%%1=1, %%%%2=2, ... 
%%%%.=.
; insert two zeros in the middle of the number (111148581234 => 11110048581234)
....48=....0048
; even this is possible (415161 => 041051061)
4.5.6=04.05.06
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Using IPv6
<p>
To use IPv6 with GnuGk, you must enable it in the config file:

<tscreen><verb>
[Gatekeeper::Main]
EnableIPv6=1
</verb></tscreen>

Calls between IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints are automatically put into proxy-mode
to allow GnuGk to perform address translation.
If your endpoints can automatically handle mixed
IPv4-IPv6 calls the auto-proxying can be disabled using the
<tt/AutoProxyIPv4ToIPv6Calls/ switch in the [RoutedMode] section.
As of 2011-11-10 there don't appear to be any endpoints which can do this.

To support IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints at the same time, GnuGk relies
on the operating system to manage IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses.
With a few exception, most current operating systems support this.

Operating System Overview:
<itemize>
<item><bf/Linux/ OK
<item><bf/Windows 7/ OK
<item><bf/Windows Server 2008/ OK
<item><bf/Windows Vista/ OK
<item><bf/Windows XP/ either IPv4 or IPv6
<item><bf/FreeBSD/ OK
<item><bf/NetBSD/ OK
<item><bf/OpenBSD/ either IPv4 or IPv6
<item><bf/Solaris/ OK
</itemize>

For Windows, you need at least Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or newer.
On Windows XP GnuGk will run as a IPv6-only gatekeeper if you enable IPv6 support.
OpenBSD doesn't support IPv4 mapped addresses at all (latest version tested: OpenBSD 5.0),
so it can only run GnuGk as either an IPv4 or IPv6 gatekeeper.

As of December 2011, IPv6 support in endpoints is known to work with the following:
<itemize>
<item>Most Tandberg devices with a recent firmware support IPv6
(eg. C series, EX90 or VCS).
<item>Polycom HDX endpoints with firmware 3.0 or higher.
<item>Spranto 2.6.0.14 or higher.
</itemize>

Known to not work:
<itemize>
<item>LifeSize endpoints do not support an IPv6 gatekeeper.
</itemize>
