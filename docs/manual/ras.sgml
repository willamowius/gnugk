<sect>RAS Configuration
<p>
<sect1>Section &lsqb;ReplyToRasAddress&rsqb;
<p>
Some messages from endpoints to the gatekeeper (GatekeeperRequest,
RegistrationRequest and InfoRequestResponse) contain an element
<it/rasAddress/ where the endpoint tells the gatekeeper where to
send the response to these messages.
By default GnuGk will ignore this address and respond to the IP and port
where it has received the request from. It does so, because some endpoints
rely on this behavior and in case where eg. a NAT is used, the response may
not reach the sender if it is sent to another IP and port. Usually endpoints
will send the RAS messages from their RAS port anyway, so it doesn't make a difference.

This section allows you to define when GnuGk should use the rasAddress inside the
message it has received instead of the address where it has received the message from.

<descrip>
<tag/Syntax:/

<tt/network=True|False/
</descrip>

The network is specified by an IP plus optional CIDR, eg. 192.168.1.0/24.
The network specifies the IP where the RAS message is received from, the setting specifies
whether to use the rasAddress. The default is not to use it.
The rule for the network with the longest netmask is used (the most specific).
<p>

<descrip>
<tag/Example:/

In this example messages from the 192.168.0.0/18 will use the rasAddress,
except for messages coming from the 192.168.4.0/24 network.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::GWPrefixes&rsqb;
<label id="gwprefixes">
<p>
This section configures how dialed E.164 numbers are routed to a specific gateway.

<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt>gw-alias=prefix[:=priority][,prefix[:=priority],...]</tt>
<p>
Note that you must specify the alias of the gateway.
If a gateway has registered with the specified alias, all numbers beginning with
the prefixes are routed to that gateway. Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/
can be used here to match any digit or to disable the prefix.
A priority can be given to each prefix for each gateway (using := syntax),
so that if several gateways match the dialed number, the one
with the highest prefix priority will be selected to route the call (when
the ActivateFailover switch is ON, the call will be routed to all selected
gateways in order of the prefix priority).  A smaller value corresponds to
a higher priority.  Default value is 1.  If the prefix priority
and overlaps the GatewayPriority (see section <ref id="epconfig"
name="[EP::...]">), the prefix priority will be preferred.

In the following example, the gateway "test-gw" will be responsible for
prefixes "02" and "03" with a priority of 3, and for "04" with a priority
of 1.

<tag/Example:/
<tt/test-gw=02,03:=3,04:=1/
</descrip>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::PermanentEndpoints&rsqb;
<p>
In this section you may configure endpoints that don't have RAS support
or that you don't want to be expired. Their records will always
remain in the registration table of the gatekeeper.
However, you can still unregister it via the status port.
Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/
can be used with prefixes here to match any digit and disable the prefix.
You may use := syntax to set a prefix priority in the same manner as in <ref id="gwprefixes" name="[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]"> section.

Make sure you add at least one prefix for all gateways,
even if you assign the prefixes elsewhere (eg. in the [EP::...] section),
otherwise the endpoint won't be considered a gateway and those settings won't apply!

<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt>IP[:port]=alias[,alias,...;prefix[:=priority][,prefix[:=priority]]...]</tt>
<tag/Example:/
For gateway,
<quote/<tt/10.0.1.5=MyGW;009,008:=2,0.7:=3//
For terminal,
<quote/<tt/10.0.1.10:1720=700//
</descrip>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::RRQFeatures&rsqb;
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/AcceptEndpointIdentifier=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Whether to accept <bf/endpointIdentifier/ specified in a full RRQ.

<item><tt/AcceptGatewayPrefixes=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
A gateway can register its prefixes with the gatekeeper by sending
<bf/supportedPrefixes/ in the <bf/terminalType/ field of the RRQ.
This option defines whether to accept the specified prefixes of a gateway.

<item><tt/AcceptMCUPrefixes=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
A MCU can register its prefixes with the gatekeeper by sending 
<bf/supportedPrefixes/ in the <bf/terminalType/ field of the RRQ.
This option defines whether to accept the specified prefixes of a MCU.


<item><tt/OverwriteEPOnSameAddress=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
In some networks an endpoint's IP address may change unexpectedly.  This
may happen when an endpoint is using a PPP connection (e.g. modem or ADSL).
This option defines how to handle a registration request (RRQ) from an IP
address which does not match what we have stored.  The default action is
to reject the request.  With this option enabled the conflicting request
will cause an unregister request (URQ) to be sent for the existing IP
address and the entry to be removed, allowing the endpoint to register
with the new address.

<item><tt/IRQPollCount=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
When the gatekeeper does not receive a keep-alive RRQ from an endpoint
within the TimeToLive time period, it sends an IRQ message to "poll" the endpoint
and check if it is alive. After IRQPollCount messages are sent and no reply
is received, the endpoint is unregistered. To disable this feature (and unregister
endpoints immediately after TimeToLive timeout), set this variable to 0.
IRQ poll interval is 60 seconds.

<item><tt/SupportDynamicIP=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
When the IP address of an endpoint changes, the gatekeeper can maintain registration. 
This will force the EP to fully re-register if its IP address changes. 

<item><tt>AccHTTPLink=https://billing.mysite.com?account=%a&amp;password=%p</tt><newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
You can assign a URL for clients to access to view billing information.
If using PacPhone you can also add wildcards for the client to use so the clients 
H323ID and password can be used to directly access their account information.
    %a - H323ID   %p - password 

<item><tt>AliasTypeFilter=terminal;h323id,dialeddigits</tt><newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Use this setting where endpoints send multiple H225_AliasAddress and some Aliases are
shared across multiple registrations. You can filter out the shared alias types for
any given endpoint type. The registrations will keep all alias types listed in the
filter setting and remove all others.
You must have separate AliasTypeFilter entries for each endpoint type.
Valid endpoint types are: gatekeeper, gateway, mcu and terminal.
Valid filters are: h323id, dialeddigits, url, transport, email and partynumber.
NOTE: If no alias is found that match the filter then all aliases are registered.
</itemize>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::ARQFeatures&rsqb;
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/ArjReasonRouteCallToGatekeeper=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
If enabled, the gatekeeper rejects an answered ARQ without a pre-existing
CallRec found in the CallTable by reason <bf/routeCallToGatekeeper/
in routed mode.
The endpoint shall release the call immediately and re-send call Setup
to the gatekeeper.

<item><tt/RemoveTrailingChar=#/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Specify the trailing character to be removed in <bf/destinationInfo/.
For example, if your endpoint incorrectly contains a termination character
such as `&num;' in <bf/destinationInfo/ you may remove it with this option.

<item><tt/RoundRobinGateways=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Enable/disable round-robin gateway selection if more than one gateway
matches a dialed number. If disabled, the first available gateway will be selected.
Otherwise, subsequent calls will be sent to gateways in round-robin fashion.

<item><tt/SendRIP=9000/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
Send a RequestInProgress (RIP) message with this delay value after receiving an ARQ.
This switch can be used to extend the duration the caller will wait for an answer.
No RIP is sent when the delay ist set to 0.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::AlternateGatekeeper&rsqb;
<label id="rassrvalternategatekeeper">
<p>
This section allows you to override the global definition of <ref id="alternategks" name="AlternateGKs">
from the [Gatekeeper::Main] section for certain IPs or IP ranges.
See there for a detailed definition of the config options.

The network is specified by an IP plus optional CIDR, eg. 192.168.1.0/24.
The rule for the network with the longest netmask is used (the most specific).
<p>

<descrip>
<tag/Example:/

In this example, 192.168.1.10 gets assigned GnuGk10 as alternate gatekeeper,
while the rest of the 192.168.0.0/18 network will use GnuGk4. Endpoints in
all other networks will use the globally defined alternate gatekeeper. 

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

</descrip>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::AssignedGatekeeper&rsqb;
<p>
This allows the assigning of a gatekeeper based upon the H323ID or the
apparent source IP address of the registering endpoint.
The received H323ID in the GRQ is checked to see if it has a prefix
for an assigned gatekeeper or the IP is in a range of an assigned
gatekeeper.
The endpoint is then advised in the GCF to register with that gatekeeper.
You may have multiple gatekeepers for a specific prefix.  The first
is assigned as the primary and others are then the alternates.
(requires H.323v6)
