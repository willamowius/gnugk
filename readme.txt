There are a number of documents in docs/ subdirectory to get you
started working with the gatekeeper. The most important is the
users manual. It's in SGML (linuxdoc) format. You can convert
it into HTML, plain text or LaTeX format by sgmltools:

$ sgml2html manual.sgml
$ sgml2txt manual.sgml
$ sgml2latex manual.sgml

There are a number of useful configuration examples in
the etc/ subdirectory. Modify them to suit your needs.
