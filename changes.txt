  (eg. gatekeeper.ini in the current directory, or set a path on the
  command line with -c)
- support for failover to other gatekeepers
- RAS messages can be forwarded to other gatekeepers
- TCP parameters can be configured in the config file
- what gateway to use on what E.164 prefix can be specified in the
  config file
- overlapped sending: specify in the config file when to send
  "incompleteAddress" on ARQ and collect more digits

  their IP numbers
- rule based authentication for usage of the status port
- alias rewriting: the gatekeeper has a list of E.164 aliases
  that are replaced by another E.164 number
- many bug fixes...

- the timeToLive filed in RCF can be set on the command line with -l

Most of the changes in this release are donated by folks at MediaWays
(Markus Storm and Torsten Will).
They sent more stuff than I can mention here.


Changes from 0.10 to 0.11
=========================

- many memory leaks fixed
  by Damian Slee

  patch by Ashley Unitt
- more detailed status messages (see GkStatusMsgFmt.html)
  input from Henrik Joerring

  by nils@shkoo.com


Changes from 0.9 to 0.10
========================

- trace messages now use the Pwlib trace facility (use -t or -tt ... to
  turn them on and -o to write to a file)
  patch from Seungoh Jhung
- support for lightweight registration updates
- on shutdown all registered endpoint receive a UnregistrationRequest
- support for gateways: for gateways we only compare the prefix of
  the E.164 address the gateway registered and assume that the gateway
  provides access to the whole address space (needs testing!)
  input from Frank Breitenbach
- new command line option -h <ip> to specify the ip number the
  gatekeeper binds to. Now you can use IP aliases on Linux and
  start as many gatekeepers as you want.
  input from Markus Storm

  input from Seungoh Jhung
- bugfixes
  from many contributors...

  a full-fledged interface to the gatekeeper
- all mandatory RAS messages implemented
